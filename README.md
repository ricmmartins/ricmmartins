<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

As a team member I'm someone with a multi-cultural experience and diverse expertise working with customers from different industries (telco, manufacturing, retail, finance, oil and gas). Since 2015 I have been in Microsoft building strong skills as Cloud Solution Architect, Technical Trainer and Systems Engineer.

- 💼 &nbsp; Currenlty I'm part of Azure Fasttrack Team working with infrastructure projects.

- 🌱 &nbsp; I’ve a special interest in Cloud Technologies, DevOps, CloudOps, Reliability Engineering, Infrastrucure as a Code and Content Development.

- 💬 &nbsp; I’m also a huge passionate by communities, tech talks and an evangelist of the DevOps culture because I understand that this is the path we should all pursue, being closer and closer to software development, not necessarily as a developer, but as a person of infrastructure who knows what a developer really needs and the ability to deliver it in a simple, autonomous and fast way.
